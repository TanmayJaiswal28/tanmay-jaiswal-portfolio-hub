Project Title: Multi-Page HTML Website (Unstyled)

Project Description:
I've created a semantic HTML-only website with four interconnected pages:

Homepage (index.html) - Introduction and main content

Projects (projects.html) - Showcase of my work

Articles (articles.html) - Blog-style content

Contact (contact.html) - With a functional form

Key Features:
✅ Proper HTML5 semantic structure (header, nav, main, section, footer)
✅ Consistent navigation across all pages
✅ SEO-optimized with meta tags (description, keywords, viewport)
✅ Contact form with basic fields (name, email, message)
✅ Clean, unstyled markup ready for future CSS implementation

Technical Implementation:

Pure HTML with no CSS or JavaScript

Logical document structure for easy styling later

Accessible form labels and input fields

Relative linking between all pages

Files Included:

index.html

projects.html

articles.html

contact.html

This project demonstrates my understanding of:

Multi-page website architecture

Semantic HTML best practices

Basic SEO principles

Form structure and accessibility
